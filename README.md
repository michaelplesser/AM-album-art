# AM-album-art
Find an analytical form for the Artic Monkeys AM album cover using the leading terms from a fourier transform

Super quick and dirty little project.
Using the first three terms of the imaginary part of the transform gives you a pretty good approximation of the album art. My goal wasn't a perfect reconstruction, just to get something with a reasonably small number of terms that looks reasonably good. So I'm just gonna leave it as is, more or less.
